## Getting started with SvelteJS v3

This is a simple web using [Svelte](https://v3.svelte.technology) from [svelte-starter-template](https://github.com/Holben888/svelte-starter-template.git). To get going, make sure we have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

...install all project dependencies...

```
npm install
```

...and build the application.

```
npm run build
```

File `rollup.config.js` imports for "live-reload" and "serve." These allow the website to rebuild itself automatically when you add new code.
